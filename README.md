About the page

The site is a Patient Registration Portal of We’R’FAKE Medical.
Once a user accesses the homepage (index.html) he or she is automatically redirected to the main registration form after 3 seconds.

The shape (patient-form.html) receives the information about a patient:

Personal data (name, date of birth, social security number, telephone numbers)

Contact address and emergency.

Medical history, vaccination, insurance, health status (through sliders and checkboxes)

Account data (Username, password with validation)

After filling it, a click of Review will dynamically reload the input information into the same page in an ordered three-column table with validation statuses pass / error.
On satisfaction, the user is then able to submit to the thankyou.html confirmation page.
The design incorporates a separate CSS file and a clean footer in line with your prior one.
